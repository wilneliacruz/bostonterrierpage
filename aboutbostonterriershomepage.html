 <p>The Boston Terrier is a native American canine breed. They originated in 1870 and were created by breeding an English Bulldog with a white English Terrier.  It is hard to believe that they were bred to be pit-fighters. The breed is now nicknamed the <q>American Gentleman</q> because of their gentle disposition.</p> 
    <p>The Boston Terrier is usually a elegant, intelligent, friendly, well-mannered and loving canine. Boston Terriers are known for being very intelligent, sometimes too much so. Their lively, affectionate nature makes them extremely loveable, though their sometimes stubborn nature or spurts of hyperactivity can land them in hot water with their owners. Any angst about their behavior, however, soon melts when they look up at you with those huge, round eyes that seem to say <q>I love you.</q></p>
    <p>Although Boston Terriers are small, they're sturdy and muscular. They have a sleek, shiny, straight coat with crisp white markings in a pattern that resembles a tuxedo, part of the reason they gained the name American Gentleman. Boston Terriers' distinctive ears naturally stand erect and are quite large. And then there's those big, beautiful eyes that are set quite apart to add to their outstanding good looks.</p>
    <p>The Boston Terrier's small size and playful nature make him a great family pet and companion. They love children and amuse people of all ages with their antics and unique, appealing expression. Although gentle and even-tempered, they can have the spunky attitude of their terrier ancestors.</p>
